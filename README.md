## Potential Problem Statements
1. Predict the hourly demand for bike rentals using weather and seasonal information.
2. Identify factors that significantly affect the demand for bike rentals and quantify their impact.
3. Classify bike rental demand into categories such as low, medium, and high based on the given features.
4. Analyze the impact of weather conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed, on bike rental demand.
5. Investigate if there is a difference in bike rental patterns between weekdays and weekends or between different seasons.
6. Determine if certain times of the day have consistently higher or lower bike rental demand, and identify possible reasons for these patterns.
7. Examine the relationship between bike rental demand and user types (e.g., casual users vs. registered users).
8. Assess the influence of holiday periods on bike rental demand and how it compares to regular days.
9. Analyze the impact of extreme weather events, such as heavy rain or snow, on bike rental demand and identify potential strategies to mitigate their effects.
10. Evaluate the effectiveness of various machine learning models in predicting bike rental demand and recommend the best approach for this dataset.

## Steps for Regression and Classification Approach
1. **Data Exploration and Preparation:**
   a. Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and any missing values.
   b. Perform data cleaning, handling missing values, and any necessary transformations.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   a. Create new features or modify existing ones, if needed, to improve the predictive power of the model.
   b. Determine the relevant features for your regression or classification problem using techniques like correlation analysis or feature selection methods.

3. **Data Splitting:**
   a. Split the dataset into training and testing sets, typically using a 70:30 or 80:20 ratio.

4. **Regression Problem:**
   a. Train various regression models (e.g., linear regression, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting) on the training data.
   b. Evaluate each model's performance on the testing data using appropriate metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or R-squared.
   c. Fine-tune the best-performing model using hyperparameter tuning techniques, such as grid search or random search.

5. **Classification Problem:**
   a. Define thresholds for low, medium, and high demand categories based on the distribution of bike rentals.
   b. Train various classification models (e.g., logistic regression,
